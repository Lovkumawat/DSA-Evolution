Given two integers m and n , return the position (1-based from the right) of the rightmost bit where they differ in binary, or -1 if both are identical.

Examples: 

Input: m = 11, n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.
Input: m = 52, n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 110100 and 0100, 5th-bit from right is different.
Input: m = 29, n = 15
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 29 in binary is 11101, 15 in binary is 01111. The 2nd bit from the right is different.
Constraints:
0 ≤ m, n ≤ 109

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: max(log m, log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
