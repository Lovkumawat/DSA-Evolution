Given a matrix of size N x N. Print the elements of the matrix in the snake like pattern depicted below.


Examples :

Input: N = 3, matrix[][] = [[45, 48, 54], [21, 89, 87], [70, 78, 15]]
Output: 45 48 54 87 89 21 70 78 15 
Explanation: Printing it in snake pattern will lead to the output as 45 48 54 87 89 21 70 78 15.
Input: N = 2, matrix[][] = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
Output: 1 2 4 3 
Explanation: Printing it in snake pattern will give output as 1 2 4 3.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 109
